# PhenomeNet Variant Predictor (PVP) - User Guide
A phenotype-based tool to annotate and prioritize disease variants in WES and WGS data

This user guide have been tested on Ubuntu version 16.04.

For details regarding model training and evaluation, please refer to  dev/ directory above.

## Hardware requirements
 - At least 128 GB RAM.
 - At least 1TB free disk space to process and accommodate the necessary databases for annotation

## Software requirements (for native installation)
 - Any Unix-based operating system
 - Java 8
 - Python 2.7 (as a system default version) and install the dependencies (for Python 2.7) with:
 ```
	pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 - Run python 2 for the script test.py (available above) to test the installation of the python dependencies. If the script fails, please try again to install the required dependencies ( using "pip2" instead of "pip", checking for permissions, or try the docker image instead).

## Usage:

To run the tool, the user needs to provide a **VCF file** along with either an **OMIM ID** of the disease or a **list of phenotypes (HPO or MPO terms)**.

a) Prioritize disease-causing variants using an OMIM ID:

	bin/phenomenet-vp -f data/Miller.vcf -o OMIM:263750
	
b) Prioritize digenic disease-causing variants using an OMIM ID, and gene-to-phenotype datta from human studies only:

	bin/phenomenet-vp -f data/Miller.vcf -o OMIM:263750 --human --digenic
	
c) Prioritize disease-causing variants using a set of phenotypes, and recessive inheritance mode

	bin/phenomenet-vp -f data/Miller.vcf -p HP:0000007,HP:0000028,HP:0000054,HP:0000077,HP:0000175 -i recessive 
   
The result file will be at the directory containg the input file. The output file has the same name as input file with **.res** extension. For digenic, trigenic or oligogenic prioritization, the result file will have ***.digenic, .trigenic, or .oligogenic*** extension repectivly.
   
# Analysis of Rare Variants:

In order to effectively analysis rare variants, it is strongly recommended to *filter the input VCF files by MAF* prior to running phenomenet-vp on it. To do so, follow the instructions below:

a) Install [VCFtools](https://vcftools.github.io/index.html).

b) Run the following command using VCFtools on your input VCF file *to filter out variants with MAF > 1%*:

	vcftools --vcf input_file.vcf --recode --max-maf 0.01 --out filtered
	
c) Run **PVP** on the output file *filtered.recode.vcf* generated from the command above.

# DeepPVP

The updated neural-network model, DeepPVP is available to download [here](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/phenomenet-vp/releases/download/v2.0/phenomenet-vp-2.1.zip) along with its required data files [here](http://bio2vec.net/pvp/data-v2.1.tar.gz). The prepared set of exomes used for the analysis and comparative results are provided [here](http://bio2vec.net/pvp/deepPVP/clinvar/). The comparison with PVP is based on PVP-1.1 available [here](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/phenomenet-vp/releases/download/v1.1/phenomenet-vp-1.1.zip) along with its required data files [here](http://bio2vec.net/pvp/data-v1.1.tar.gz).

# OligoPVP

OligoPVP is provided as part of DeepPVP tool using the parameters --digenic, --trigenicm and --oligogenic for ranking candidate disease-causing variant pairs and triples. Our prepared set of synthetic genomes digenic combinations are available [here](http://bio2vec.net/pvp/deepPVP/dida/) using data from the DIgenic diseases DAtabase (DIDA). The comparison results with other methods are also provided. Results were obtained using DeepPVP v2.0.
